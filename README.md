## Introduction
Hello üëãüèº, 

You found the assessment for the front-end development job position. This assessment gives us more insights into __how__ you might solve the issues at hand. 
 
During this assessment, you will create a front-end view for a mock-API. This mock data is based upon a white-label service we offer. The service allows customers to share order information with their clients, without the need to communicate constantly.

**Although most data is anonymized we expect you to keep the data private**


## Assignment

You will create a Single Page Application that can display the data from the mock-API.
You will need to create a mechanism that retrieves data via an API and display it in the front-end.  You are free to use any JS framework you want. We are more interested in the solution than the technical frameworks. For the CSS you are free to use any framework, except for Bootstrap. 

The API has three several orders you can use. We expect that the application can handle all orders.

When you are finished, you will push your work into a separate branch or as a PR. 

If you are up for a challenge you are free to deploy the site via Netlify.

### API Endpoints
| Order      | URL  |

### Resources
We do not expect you to deliver a pixel-perfect result, but you need to come very close. In the  `./resources/previews` folder, you will find the examples.
